# Numerical Methods and Machine Learning for Differential Equations with Applications in Python
This github consists of Python code corresponding to the TU Dublin module Numerical Methods and Machine Learning for Differential Equations.
The aim of this module is to equip the learner with the knowledge necessary to implement computational techniques related to finite-difference methods and machine learning method for differential equations. 

During the first part of the module the learner will be introduced to the theory and practice of common techniques for the numerical integration of ordinary differential equations with initial conditions.
Second part will of the module the learner will be introduced to the application machine learning methods to estimate the solution of linear and non-linear ordinary differential equations. 
Software tools (python) will be used to implement the numerical and machine learning methods
