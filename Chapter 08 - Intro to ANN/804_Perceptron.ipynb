    "## The Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "The perceptron is a fundamental concept in the field of artificial neural networks and machine learning. It was introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in the late 1950s and is a simplified model of a biological neuron. Here's a summary of the perceptron:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure**:\n",
    "The perceptron is a simple neural network model with the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Features**: It takes a set of input features (\\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weights**: Each input feature is associated with a weight (\\(w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n\\)), which represents the strength of the connection from the input to the perceptron.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Summation Function**: It calculates the weighted sum of the input features and weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \\[z = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \\ldots + w_nx_n\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Activation Function**: The perceptron uses a threshold activation function (typically a step function) to make a binary decision based on the weighted sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operation**:\n",
    "The perceptron operates as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It receives input features \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\) along with associated weights \\(w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It calculates the weighted sum \\(z = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \\ldots + w_nx_n\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It applies the threshold activation function, comparing the weighted sum \\(z\\) to a predefined threshold value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If \\(z\\) is greater than or equal to the threshold, the perceptron outputs 1 (or \"fires\"). If \\(z\\) is less than the threshold, it outputs 0 (or remains inactive).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning**:\n",
    "The perceptron can be trained to adjust its weights by using a simple learning rule, such as the perceptron learning rule, which updates the weights based on the error in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**:\n",
    "The perceptron is a linear binary classifier and has several limitations:\n",
    "- It can only represent linear decision boundaries.\n",
    "- It cannot solve problems that are not linearly separable.\n",
    "- It does not perform well on more complex tasks.\n",
    "\n"
