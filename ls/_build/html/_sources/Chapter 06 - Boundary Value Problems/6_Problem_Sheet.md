# Problem Sheet 6 - Boundary Value Problems
1. 	Consider the boundary value problem 
\begin{equation} y''=3xy'-4y+x^2, \ \ 1\leq x \leq 2, \ \ y(1)=2,\ \ \ y(2)=-1.\end{equation} 
	Apply the linear shooting method to transform this equation into two second order initial value problems
	and approximate the solution using the Euler method with stepsize $h=\frac{1}{3}.$
