# Jupyterbook Support

We use [jupyterbook](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) to create a condensed,
single interface to all our course materials. This book will be autogenerated
and published to [https://github.com/john-s-butler-dit/Numerical-Analysis-Python] every time
a PR is merged into the master branch.

In order to build the book locally, you will need to do the following:

1. Install jupyter-book 

`pip install jupyter-book`


2. Clean the book


`jupyter-book clean NM_and_ML_for_DEs_Book/'

3. First build of the book

`jupyter-book build --all Numerical-and-Machine-Learning-Methods-for-Differential-Equations_orig/`

4. Subsequent builds of the book

`jupyter-book build Numerical-and-Machine-Learning-Methods-for-Differential-Equations_orig/`

5. Now copy contents to webpage folder

`cp -R Numerical-and-Machine-Learning-Methods-for-Differential-Equations_orig/ Numerical-and-Machine-Learning-Methods-for-Differential-Equations/`

6. Install github pages

`pip install ghp-import`


7. Go to NM_and_ML_for_DEs_BookOnline folder
` cd NM_and_ML_for_DEs_Book/`

8. Push to GIT using Desktop
https://github.com/john-s-butler-dit/Numerical-and-Machine-Learning-Methods-for-Differential-Equations/tree/master



Now enjoy:
